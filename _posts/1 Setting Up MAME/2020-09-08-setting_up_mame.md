At the beginning of any project, it is difficult to know where to start. In this case, however, it seemed pretty obvious. You can't have a MAME arcade machine without setting up MAME, so that was our first task.

We ended up buying a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a fancy-looking Miuzei clear case with with built in cooling fan. We did not buy a dedicated monitor for this project, but instead used an old HP L1710 from Claudia's parents' house. After booting [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) from an SD card, we set out to find some ROMs.

ROMS are notoriously difficult to find if you are new to the classic arcade emulator scene. Not everyone approves of using them, and consequently there exists a culture of "find them yourself" within the community.

However, our search was not too bad, and getting the ROMS setup on the Pi was as easy as dragging and dropping files in the correct folders. After that, we hooked up a couple of my PS4 controllers to the Pi and started playing games.

The result:
